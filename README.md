## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 and created with Google Colab. It utilizes the following packages:

**[Pandas Library Python](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** - a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool.<br>

**[HoloViews Library Python](https://holoviews.org/)** - an open-source Python library designed to make data analysis and visualization seamless and simple. <br>

**[Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)** - is open source software released by Facebookâ€™s Core Data Science team. Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.<br>

**[datetime Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)** - supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.<br>

**[Numpy Library Python](https://numpy.org/)** -  comprehensive mathematical functions.<br>

**[Matplotlib Python](https://matplotlib.org/)** - comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.<br>
